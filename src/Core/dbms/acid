ACID stand for Atomicity , Consistency , Isolation , Durablity

           Transction : A transction in DBMS is a sequnece of one or more operations performed as a single logical unit 
           of work on the database.

 
Atomicity - A transction is all or nothing , Either all operations is the tranctions
            completed, or none are. No partial updates are allowed.

            example : transferring money from A to B; either both debit and credit happen , or neither.

Consistency : A transtion brings the database from one valid state to another , preserving all predefined rules,
             constraints, and integrity.
 
             example : After a transction, the total balance in a bank must still equal the sum of all individual accounts.

Isolation : Concurrent transctions do not interfare  with each other. the intermediate states of a transction 
             invisible to other transctions until commited.

             example : two people booking seats at the same time , each sees a consistent 
             view , avoiding double-booking.

Durablity : Once a transction is commited , its changes are permanent , even if there is a system
             failure immediately afterward.

             example : After a successfull payment , the record remains in the database despites crashes.
