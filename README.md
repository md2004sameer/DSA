🧠 Daily DSA Practice

Welcome to my **Daily Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice** repository!
I post **the problems I solve every day** from platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, **Codeforces**, and more — along with my clean, well-commented solutions.

📌 About This Repo

This is my **personal coding log** where I:

* Solve at least **one DSA problem every day** 📅
* Strengthen problem-solving skills & algorithmic thinking
* Explore multiple approaches to the same problem
* Keep track of progress and revisit solutions for improvements
* Share solutions for others to learn from

🚀 My Practice Workflow

1. Pick a topic or a random problem from coding platforms
2. Solve it while focusing on clarity and optimization
3. Push the solution to GitHub **daily**
4. Revisit older problems to improve them over time
